Efficient FPGA-Based Real-Time Implementation of Model Predictive Control for Single-Phase Direct Matrix Converter
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15325008.2021.1908448
Finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) is an optimal control strategy that solves user-defined objective functions to determine the best control action for the next time interval. Real-time implementations of model predictive control techniques are quite challenging for certain topologies due to computation complexities. In this paper, key aspects of achieving robust, reliable, and efficient field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) based model predictive control are presented for single-phase direct matrix topology. The effectiveness of FPGA-based model predictive control is validated experimentally using an ALTERA Cyclone IV FPGA. Experimental results show that an effective load current control performance is obtained by taking advantage of pipelining capability of the FPGA device. The tradeoff between control bandwidth, FPGA resources, and hardware utilization is discussed.
